Miscellaneous Tips
=============================


Add the ``fsimcluster`` column to your AWS management console
----------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've deployed a simulation once with the manager, the AWS management console
will allow you to add a custom column that will allow you to see at-a-glance
which FireSim run farm an instance belongs to.

To do so, click the gear in the top right of the AWS management console. From
there, you should see a checkbox for ``fsimcluster``. Enable it to see the column.
